               Over my career I've worked at several different zoos in 6 different states. I had the opportunity to work with a wide variety of animals and even moreso people. Here's just a bit about each place I've lived and worked.

                   In highschool I started volunteering at the Denver Zoo through the zoo's Boy Scout explorer post. I lovingly referred to my position as "keeper slave" and loved avery minute of it. I mainly worked with pachyderms and hoofstock, but I got to do a little with carnivores, pinnipeds, birds, and primates. It was at this zoo I fell in love with elephants. Mimi and Dolly gave me the inspiration to go to college and get my bachelors degree in Biology.

                   After college I got my first internship at the Toledo Zoo in Toledo, OH. They were running a pilot program in their elephant department, and I was lucky enough to be the zoo's very first elephant intern. During my time there I cared for and trained Renee and her young calf Louie. Renee is an amazing elephant, and my mentors Don RedFox and Ben Whitebread taught me everything they could in six months. During that time I also got to help with two artificial inseminations on Renee and the second one resulted in her second calf, Lucas, who was born 22 months later. I felt like a proud aunt when Lucas was born. The elephants at the Toledo Zoo solidified my love of animals big and grey, and soon I was off to my first fulltime job as an elephant keeper.

               <p>
                   This zoo seems like an unlikely place for elephants, but they were a big part of the zoo until 2015 when the elephant were moved to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs, CO after the city decided not to invest in updating the aging elephant building. The Lee Richardson Zoo is located in Garden City, KS. A very small town, about 8 hours from anywhere.I took care of Missy and Kimba, the zoo's two African Elephants. Those girls are feisty, especially Kimba.Missy was stubborn, and had to have a good reason (SNACKS!) to do anything you wanted her to do, but Kimba was always looking for trouble. Trying to steal tools,throw things at people, snatch food that wasn't for her, breaking toys we spent hours building for her. Anything she could do to get attention. I loved them both and still miss them dearly.

                   At the Detroit Zoo I had a unique role as a keeper. I was the Quarantine keeper, which means I took care of every single new mammal that came into the zoo. Even though zoos do thorough health checks before sending an animal to another zoo, sometimes those animals can bring diseases and parasites with them that would harm the animals at the new zoo. The receiving zoo houses new animals in a separate area with separate keepers for at least 30 days to make sure the new animal is healthy and ready to go into the main part of the zoo. This means I had a chance to take care of far more species than a keeper regularly would. Wolverines, tigers, beavers, otters, tree kangaroos, red pandas, lion-tailed macaques, lions, warthogs, lesser kudu, and many many others.

                   At the Saint Louis Zoo I was an Antelope Keeper, folks who are familiar with the Zoo can see the animals I cared for in Red Rocks, the mainly hoofstock section of the zoo. The giraffes and zebras are probably our most famous residents followed closely by the Somali Wild-Ass.
